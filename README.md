# Eye-Controlled Mouse  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Eye-Controlled Mouse** is an AI-powered system that enables users to control the mouse cursor using their eye movements. This project utilizes **computer vision and machine learning** to track eye gaze and perform actions like clicking, scrolling, and moving the cursor.  

## 🔧 Features  
✅ Real-time eye tracking  
✅ Cursor movement based on gaze direction  
✅ Blink detection for mouse clicks  
✅ Hands-free and accessible computing  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision)  
- **Dlib** (for facial landmark detection)  
- **Mediapipe** (optional alternative for eye tracking)  
- **Numpy**  

## 📂 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Eye-Controlled-Mouse.git
   cd Eye-Controlled-Mouse
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the project:  
   ```bash
   python eye_mouse.py
   ```

## 🖥️ How It Works  
- The program captures real-time video from the webcam.  
- It detects the **face and eyes** using OpenCV and Dlib.  
- The system **maps eye movements** to control the cursor.  
- **Blink detection** is used for mouse clicks.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Improve accuracy with **deep learning models**  
- Implement **gesture-based scrolling**  
- Support **multiple screen resolutions**
